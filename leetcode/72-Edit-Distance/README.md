# [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

## Problem

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character
 

Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

Example 2:

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
 

Constraints:

- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```go
func minDistance(word1 string, word2 string) int {
	m := len(word1)
	n := len(word2)

	dp := make([][]int, m+1)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, n+1)
	}

	for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
		dp[i][0] = i
	}
	for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
		dp[0][j] = j
	}
	for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
		for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
			if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1] {
				dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
			} else {
				dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j]+1, dp[i-1][j-1]+1, dp[i][j-1]+1)
			}
		}
	}

	return dp[m][n]
}

func min(nums ...int) int {
	result := nums[0]
	for _, num := range nums {
		if num < result {
			result = num
		}
	}
	return result
}
```
